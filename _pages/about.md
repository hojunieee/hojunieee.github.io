Welcome! And thank you for visiting my website. I am a senior at [Swarthmore College](https://www.swarthmore.edu/), double majoring in pure math (honors track) and general engineering. 

My interest lies in the intersection of **robotics**, **math**, and **societal impact**. Connecting all three fields, I am interested in topics such as bulding <u>safe and efficient Multi Robot System (MRS) with theoretical guarantees</u>, with application ranging from robotics team for disaster response to smart traffic control system.

I am currently working on my senior thesis with Professor [Matt Zucker](https://mzucker.github.io/swarthmore/) to build an affordable motion (position and orientation) tracking system for MRS using four cameras. Also, I am collaborating with Professor [John Dolan](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/john-m-dolan/) and PhD student [Yiwei Lyu](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yiweilyu/) to develop a safety-critical navigation framework for heterogeneous, decentralized MRS. Lastly, I am working with the Swarthmore Registrar's Office to build a course scheduling pipeline that generates schedules with minimal course conflicts for students while satisfying faculty preferences.

When I’m not working on these projects, I love spending time outdoors. I’m an active climber, a former midfielder for the 2018 U-17 Korean National Lacrosse Team, and I’ve even completed a cross-country cycling trip from Busan to Seoul—just don’t ask me to swim unless you want to see a live demonstration of sinking!!
